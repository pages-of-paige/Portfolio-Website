## Project Description

[Background image inspiration](https://codepen.io/collinstheuncoder/pen/YpvOpw)

This project will be a portfolio website for myself to present to future employers/clients. I want to accurately portray my artistic and technical sides, how they blend together, and what creations come out of it. I want to use round shapes wherever possible to soften the viewer's gaze and evoke a sense of calm and trust. This site will have an About Me page, a Projects page and a Contact Me page, along with an email-list sign up form and dynamic navigation menu.
